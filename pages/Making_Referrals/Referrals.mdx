  Mr Hartmann, is a 55 year old gentlemen, who was admitted on the 03/08/2023 with
  abdominal pain and fever. We confirmed the diagnosis of diverticulitis on the 07/08/2023
  and subsequently he had a Hartmann's Procedure to remove ischaemic bowel. Today,
  he is spiking temperature of 38C and her wound is discharing pus. His WCC is raised
  at XYZ, and CRP is also raised at XYZ. He is not on any antibiotics currently,
  and we were just wondering what best regime he should be started on.
